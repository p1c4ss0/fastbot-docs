## 💰 **Capital Protection Principles**

### **🔐 The Golden Rules**

#### **Rule 1: Only Trade Money You Can Afford to Lose**
- **Definition:** Money that, if lost completely, won't affect your lifestyle
- **Examples of what NOT to trade with:**
  - Emergency fund money
  - Rent or mortgage payments
  - Children's education funds
  - Retirement savings
  - Borrowed money (loans, credit cards)
  - Money needed for daily expenses

#### **Rule 2: Start Extremely Small**
- **First month:** Maximum ₹10,000-15,000
- **After 3 months of success:** Consider ₹25,000-50,000
- **After 6 months of consistent profits:** Gradually increase
- **Never risk more than 5% of your total assets**

#### **Rule 3: Separate Trading Money**
- **Dedicated trading account** - Keep trading funds completely separate
- **No mixing** - Don't use trading profits for daily expenses initially
- **Clear accounting** - Track every rupee in and out

### **📊 Position Sizing Strategy**

#### **Conservative Approach (Recommended):**
```
Total Trading Capital: ₹100,000
├── Per Trade Risk: 1% (₹1,000 maximum loss)
├── Position Size: 5% (₹5,000 per trade maximum)
├── Daily Loss Limit: 2% (₹2,000)
└── Weekly Loss Limit: 5% (₹5,000)
```

#### **How to Calculate Safe Position Sizes:**
```python
# Example calculation
trading_capital = 100000  # ₹1 lakh
max_risk_per_trade = 0.01  # 1%
max_position_size = 0.05   # 5%

# If stop loss is 2% from entry price
stop_loss_percent = 0.02
safe_position = (trading_capital * max_risk_per_trade) / stop_loss_percent
# ₹50,000 maximum position size for 2% stop loss

# But also respect maximum position size
final_position = min(safe_position, trading_capital * max_position_size)
print(f"Safe position size: ₹{final_position:,.0f}")
```
